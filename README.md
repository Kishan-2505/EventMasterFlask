# EventMasterFlask

Welcome to my Github repository!

- Created a robust web application that leverages Python, Flask, AJAX, JSON, Google API, and the Ticketmaster API to showcase event and venue details.
- To craft an engaging user experience, I employed JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS for the client-side scripting, and deployed the application on the Google Cloud platform for optimal performance and accessibility
